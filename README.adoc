This is a Clojure wrapper around Google's https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] project for "building optimized Docker and OCI container images without a Docker daemon, and without deep mastery of Docker best-practices".

This library was born from an attempt at using Jib from https://github.com/clojure/tools.build[tools.build].
